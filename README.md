# BoMBR_based_models
### Code for the paper: *BoMBR: Bone Marrow Biopsy Dataset for Segmentation of Reticulin Fibers*

This repository contains the official code accompanying the paper **“BoMBR: Bone Marrow Biopsy Dataset for Segmentation of Reticulin Fibers”**, published in the *Medical Imaging with Deep Learning for Biomedical Applications (MELBA) Journal*, Volume 3, Special Issue: MICCAI Open Data (2025).

The repository provides scripts to train and perform inference on both the **segmentation** and **classification** models described in the paper. Together, these models form a pipeline for analyzing bone marrow biopsy (BMB) images for fibrosis grading.
